## How do I play?

The goal is simple, get to the water while avoiding the enemies presented in each row.
We do this by using the arrow keys. 
Timing will be of the essence since our enemies will appear from the left side at random speeds.
We're keeping score in the bottom left corner, each time you reach the water you earn one point and our hero resets to the initial position.


## What happens if I lose?

The score resets and so do our character's positions.
